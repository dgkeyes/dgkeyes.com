              <h3>What I'm doing now</h3>
              <p>As of March 2023, here are a few things I'm focused on:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Working as a freelance web developer and designer, taking on
                  projects for clients across various industries.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Learning React.js and improving my skills in front-end
                  development to stay up to date with the latest web development
                  trends.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Reading books on personal development and productivity, trying
                  to find ways to optimize my workflow and improve my work-life
                  balance.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Taking online courses on digital marketing and SEO to expand
                  my skillset and offer additional services to my clients.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Spending time outdoors and staying active through hiking and
                  cycling, as a way to balance my work with physical activity
                  and mental relaxation.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>What I'm Not Doing</h3>
              <p>
                To focus on the things that matter most, here are a few things
                I'm intentionally not doing right now:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Taking on any long-term commitments that would interfere with
                  my ability to deliver quality work to my clients.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Spending too much time on social media or other distractions
                  that could take away from my productivity and creativity.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Neglecting my physical and mental health by skipping workouts
                  or not taking time to unwind and relax outside of work.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This Now page reflects my current priorities and goals, and I
                will update it regularly as my focus and activities change over
                time.
